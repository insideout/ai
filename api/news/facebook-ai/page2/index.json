      "excerpt": "In a recent paper, researchers at Facebook AI Research assert that the first problem — the mapping problem — might be easier than the prediction problem, a hypothesis they build upon to augment language models with a “nearest neighbors” retrieval mechanism. They say it allows rare patterns to be memorized and that it achieves a state-of ...",
