title: "Reducing AI’s carbon footprint"
excerpt: "we have to figure out how to shrink AI down to size.” “The model is really compact. I am very excited to see OFA can keep pushing the boundary of efficient deep learning on edge devices,” said Chuang Gan, a researcher at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab and co-author of the paper. “If rapid progress in AI is to continue, we need to reduce its ..."
