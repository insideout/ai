title: "Artificial intelligence is energy-hungry. New hardware could curb its appetite."
excerpt: "To just solve a puzzle or play a game, artificial intelligence can require software running on thousands of computers. That could be the energy that three nuclear plants produce in one hour. A team of engineers has created hardware that can learn skills using a type of AI that currently runs on software platforms."
