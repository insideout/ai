title: "Benchmarking Deep Learning Architectures for Predicting Readmission to the ICU and Describing Patients-at-Risk"
excerpt: "To compare different deep learning architectures for predicting the risk of readmission within 30 days of discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU). The interpretability of attention-based models is leveraged to describe patients-at-risk. Several deep learning architectures making use of attention mechanisms, recurrent layers, neural ..."
